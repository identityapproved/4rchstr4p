# Arch Linux CTF Bootstrap Scripts \(ﾉ◕ヮ◕\)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

These scripts automate bootstrapping an Arch Linux system for CTF competitions and pentesting. They remain modular, idempotent, and give you control over what gets installed.

## Structure

- `bootstrap.sh` — main orchestrator; wires interactive menus to modular installers, handles logging and summaries.
- `lib/common.sh` — shared helper library for logging, package operations, menu abstraction, and summary reporting.
- `modules/` — category-specific installers:
  - `install_arch_essentials.sh`
  - `install_programming_languages.sh`
  - `install_shell_tools.sh`
  - `install_wayland_sway.sh`
  - `install_ctf_suite.sh` (dispatches to submodules)
  - `install_optional_extras.sh`
  - `install_dotfiles.sh`
  - `install_zsh_plugins.sh`
  - `install_ctf_reversing.sh`
  - `install_ctf_web.sh`
  - `install_ctf_osint.sh`
  - `install_ctf_pwn.sh`
  - `install_ctf_crypto_forensics.sh`

Logs are stored under `logs/` with timestamped files for the main run and the summary.

## Requirements

- Arch Linux with `pacman` and `sudo` configured.
- Ability to build AUR packages if you opt into AUR tools (Git, base-devel).
- Optional: `whiptail`, `dialog`, or `fzf` for richer menus (fallback prompts are provided).

## Usage

1. Clone or copy this directory onto the target machine.
2. Make sure scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x bootstrap.sh modules/*.sh lib/common.sh
   ```
3. Run the orchestrator:
   ```bash
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```
4. On first launch you’ll be asked which package manager to standardize on (`yay`, `paru`, or `pacman`). The chosen tool is installed if needed, the system is updated automatically, and all later installs go through that manager.
5. Follow the numeric prompts to pick the categories and tools you want (type selections like `1 3 5` or ranges such as `1-3`; press Enter to accept defaults, and use `0` or `q` to quit a menu).
6. Inspect `logs/bootstrap_<timestamp>.log` and `logs/summary_<timestamp>.txt` after completion for details.

Re-running the scripts is safe: all package installs use `--needed`, and pipx installs are idempotent.

## Customization Tips

- Update defaults in each module if you prefer different selections to be pre-checked.
- Extend the `modules/` scripts or add new ones; each entry simply sources `lib/common.sh` and records results.
- Drop replacement configs into `dotfiles/` to have them copied into place (existing files are backed up automatically).
- LazyVim setup relies on `fnm` to supply Node.js; adjust the helper in `install_shell_tools.sh` if you prefer a different runtime manager.
- For offline or repetitive setups, consider caching `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` and `~/.cache/yay` (or your AUR helper of choice).
- If you plan to import dotfiles or configure shells further, chain them from `bootstrap.sh` or add new modules.
